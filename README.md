# COVID-19
These are cumulative, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China at province-level. Digitized from WHO sitreps with tabula. The data is partially checked, but there may still be errors. 

Please alert me if you find inconsistencies or data entry errors. I will update this dataset periodically. 

Note: Excel sometimes has problems recognizing dates and sorting on date may turn out wrong. If you want to be sure use R or another data program for proper plotting and analysis. 

Please cite this github repository and the WHO sitreps when using the data, thank you.
